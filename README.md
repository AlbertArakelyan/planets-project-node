# Planets project node

This is my first node based project where I use node specific things such us `fs` reading files with `createReadStrem` and using `csv-parse` package I parse and display that data.

_The project was carried out within the scope of [Complete NodeJS Developer in 2023 (GraphQL, MongoDB, + more)](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-nodejs-developer-zero-to-mastery/) course._
